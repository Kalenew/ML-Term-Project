# ML-Term-Project
For my Machine Learning course term project, I trained multiple networks on UCI's Credit-Approval dataset.
 

The code makes use of two of the most powerful neural network libraries, Keras and Sci-Kit lear(sklearn).

The networks that will be trained on the data set are:
        1. Support Vector Machines(SVM)...Linear
        2. Decision Tree(DT)
        3. Multilayer Perceptron(MLP)
        4. Random Forest(RF
        5. Ada Boost(AB)
        6. Nernoulli Restricted Boltzmann's machine(BRBM)
        7. Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)

Evaluation:
For evaluation 10-fold cross validation is used, with precision, recall and fscore for each implementation at
each fold available to see.
